EXPRESSING AND UNDERSTANDING EVERYTHING IN WAVEFORM

A.	Don't commit to perfection.  It can never be reached.  Commit to mastery, commit to learning and changing.
B.	You and everything around is 99% space.  What is between the grains of sand or atoms?  
These ideas and things exist in waveform.  Its not small grains of sand or atoms/subatomics, it exists in waveform. 
We construct it into this particle form to conceptualize the universe in a way we can better understand.  Everything
exists in waveform just as it is in subatomic scale.  Thats why we can say theree is no defineable edges.  Everything is
intermingling with everything else.  its the notion that we are all sharing a certain percentage of each other.  Your
ass with your seat, your consciousness with others, its purely this waveform expression.
