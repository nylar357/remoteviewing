FIVE STEPS TO MASTERY


A. Old and New "Mission Statement"
What drives your intentions moment to moment?  The question or statement can never be
answered or finished.  Its moment to moment.

B. MASTERY THRU REPETITION
"In-CAN-tations" vs "In-CANT-ations"
WHERE FOCUS GOES ENERGY FLOWS

C. Life Intention
Your mission statement for life.  What defines your the drive to change your life?  What
are you going to decide to do differently NOW and FOREVER to make your life and intentions
reality?

D. Implementations
Manifest the incantation in your life.  It has power as a conceptual illusion.  Write it
down, manifest it to reality from illusion and MAKE IT REAL.

E. Initial Impact
END THE TRANCE! Transcend anything that prevents you from completing your goals.  Or the Idea that some 
people OTHER THAN ME can do something.  REMIND YOURSELF YOU CAN END IT IF YOU WANT.

F. Integration
Integrate those ideas and definitions into your day to day life.  Walk the path you find
in the mental illusion.  They become integrated into your being when your knowledge becomes
effortlessly integrated into your physical and mental self.

G. Reinforcement
USE IT.  Ask yourself "how am I going to apply this newfound ability?"
